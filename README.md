# wikiwad
In collaboration with Tamarah Harvey
My first university project made using Ruby and Sinatra.

In order to run our wiki application on Windows 10 you will require ruby 2.4.1. which can be downloaded from https://rubyinstaller.org. Additional gems may be required to be installed which can be done through the following console commands:

    Navigate to folder of the wiki using a terminal
    Run bundle install
    Open your preferred browser and type in the localhost:4567/ which should be the message that appears in the terminal once wiki.rb is running.

There are currently three users in the database:

    Administrator Account a. Username: Admin b. Password: admin
    User 1 a. Username: User1 b. Password: 12345
    User 2 a. Username: Ivanka b. Password: 12345
